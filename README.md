## Project Basics

The purpose of this project is to create a predictive model and an interactive web-based tool for predicting property's energy consumption based on its features and location. This tool will aim to assist homeowners, prospective buyers and real estate professionals in estimating the potential energy consumption of a property, coupled with tailored recommendations for reducing energy use. The tool will provide transparency and valuable data-driven insights that can inform negotiations, guide investment decisions and foster a more sustainable and energy-conscious property market. It will be implemented in Python, using Flask and scikit-learn.

**[coming soon]** General description of how the project will work

## Project Structure

/app/ - The folder containing the app.
/app/app.py - The main app entry point
/app/templates - Where the templates live.

/app/static - Static files, etc.

/framework/ - ???.

The main components of the app are:

1. **Base** - This module contains the skeleton that the entire framework rests on. It is responsible
   for checking for compatibility, as well as loading and securing the various sub-modules.

2. **Component X** - This component does X. It uses Google Tensorflow to do ...

3. **Component Y** - This component does Y. It uses Z to add W features.
